thanks for Bruno Stecanella in his blog here: https://monkeylearn.com/blog/practical-explanation-naive-bayes-classifier/
Our code just supported by his dataset about sport
this is a simple code using python for implement the naive bayes algorithm 
your comment and suggestion will be apreciate
#----------------------

to use the code:
make your dataset as below:

A great game y
The election was over n
Very clean match y
A clean but forgettable game y
It was a close election	n

save it with "data_file.txt" as file name

at the end of every sentence we add an additional character. It aim to use for clasifying the data set with the code
for the screenshoot of the result is shown here:
